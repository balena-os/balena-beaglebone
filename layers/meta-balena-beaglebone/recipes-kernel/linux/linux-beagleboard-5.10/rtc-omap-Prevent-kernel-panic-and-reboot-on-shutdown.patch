Subject: [PATCH] rtc-omap: Prevent kernel panic and reboot on shutdown

On some beaglebone green wireless boards the rtc
doesn't work correctly and this causes the PMIC
to not cut the power at shutdown. This causes
a kernel panic and reboot.

If this module would be disabled, then the
system would still stay on but there would
be no kernel panic.

Keep the system idle in this case.

Upstream-status: Inappropriate [configuration]
